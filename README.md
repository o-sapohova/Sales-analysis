# Sales-analysis
The goal of this project is to build comprehensive sales analytics for an online store using three tools: SQL, Python, and Tableau.

## **Tableau Visualizations**

[Sales Analysis](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/olena.sapohova/viz/SalesAnalysis_17616771890720/Metrics)

This project includes the **calculation and analysis of key sales metrics** such as revenue, number of orders, new accounts, and sessions.
The analysis is performed across multiple dimensions:
* Geography (continents, countries)
* Product categories
* Device types and device models
* Operating systems and browsers
* Traffic channels
* User language settings
* User registration, verification, and subscription status

Dynamic analysis and day-of-week patterns were explored to identify behavioral trends in the context of the above parameters.

**Statistical Analysis**

The project also includes statistical examination of relationships, calculation of correlation coefficients, and testing their statistical significance, including:
* Relationship between sales and sessions
* Sales performance across the top 3 continents and top 3 countries
* Sales differences by traffic channels and device types
* Sales in the top 5 product categories

Additionally, statistical tests were conducted to compare differences between groups:
* Sales among registered vs. unregistered users
* Number of sessions across different traffic channels
* Share of organic traffic sessions in Europe vs. America

**Results**

The project concludes with insights and data-driven recommendations for potential improvements based on the results of the analysis.
